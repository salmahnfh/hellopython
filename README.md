# hellopython
Exercise: hello, hello!
Objective: Write and call your own functions to learn how the program counter steps through code.

You will write a program that introduces you and prints your favorite number.

Write the body of the function print_favorite_number
Write a function call at the end of the program that calls print_favorite_number.
Write a new function, say_introduction that prints Hello, my name is X. and I am a Y. on two separate lines, where X and Y are replaced by whatever you like.
Add a line that calls say_introduction so that the introduction is printed before the favorite number.
Test your code after steps 2 and 4: take a minute to think through what you expect to happen, and then press the run button.
